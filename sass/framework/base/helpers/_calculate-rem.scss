| helper Calculate Rem
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Convert px to rem and provide fallback.  Rem is a value relative to root
| em
| - It works like pixels in that you donâ€™t get compounding issue like you
|   do with em and the computed value is always the same no matter where
|   the value is set.
| - In responsive design, you can set a different font-size on the <html>
|   at each breakpoint and the text on your site will scale proportionally
|   according to your root font-size.
|
| Use this for controlling font sizes
|
| Example use:
	h1 {
  		@include fontSize(32px);
	}
